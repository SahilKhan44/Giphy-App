Objective: Design a Next.js Application with Firebase Authentication and GIPHY API Integration
Project Overview:
In this technical test, the candidate is required to design and develop a Next.js application that incorporates Firebase Authentication for user login and registration. The application's main feature is a GIF search functionality powered by the GIPHY API. Additionally, the candidate has the option to implement additional tasks, such as marking GIFs as favorites, hot searching, loading animations, and hosting the app on Vercel or GitHub Pages.

Authentication Requirements:
- Users must be able to log in using their email and password or sign up for a new account.
- Firebase Authentication web SDK should be used for implementing the authentication process. Create your own Firebase account to set up the authentication.
- Reference: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth
GIF Search and Gallery:
- The application should use the GIPHY API to display a gallery of GIFs based on user-searched keywords.
- API Documentation: Docs
- API Key: GlVGYHkr3WSBnllca54iNt0yFbjz7L65
Optional Task: Marking Favorites:
- Users should have the ability to mark individual GIFs as favorites.
- A "favorites" section should be implemented on the home page, allowing users to view their selected GIFs.
Optional Task: Hot Search and Loading Animations:
- Implement a hot search feature where GIFs update dynamically as the user types, without needing to press a search button.
- Add loading animations to enhance the user experience during data fetching.
UI Design Reference:
- Use the provided Figma UI design reference for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Figma UI Design: Test App Layout
